Categories Dominant (Typically human) They can be found anywhere in the city. In any district you will be able to find the dominant species and they are meaningfully involved in the politics of the city.

Minorities (Typically Elves, dwarves and halflings) Minorities can still be found, like the dominant species, anywhere in the city, in any district. They just don't have as much political power as the dominant species. And that can be for a number of reasons.

Enclave (Could be any exotic race that tend to live in communities) An enclave is a group of a given species that can only be found in one district of the city. It could be one neighborhood. In that place, all of the signs could be in a different language to the rest of the city. They may be refugees.

Groups (Could be any exotic race that tend to live in communities) Groups are smaller than enclaves. There could be 12 of them. They are located together and all know each other. These may act as representatives for a larger populace in another location outside of the city.

Individuals (Dragonborn, tortle, firbolg, triton, goliath or drow wanderers for example or unusual births like Aasimar or Tieflings with two human parents) Folks who can be found in the city but they're each there for their own reasons. So they don't represent any kind of larger demographic population in the city. These individuals might not typically have a neighborhood or embassy in the city.

Singular (perhaps extra-planar visitors like aarakocra, angel or genasi or powerful monsters like an aboleth, beholder, vampire or dragon) There is literally only one of these.
