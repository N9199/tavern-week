# Tavern Week (WIP)
The party is group of retired adventurers who manage a tavern, they have to make it through while keeping their tavern running, and the town in one piece.

## Party
The party shouldn't be magic heavy or muscle heavy. And hopefully have at least a good CHA based character. No other requirements.

## The World
This can be inserted in any world with a sufficiently big and rowdy town or city. But by default it uses my own, The Floating Lands, a short excerpt about is included.
